# ðŸŽ¨ Color Flow App

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a gradient generator app using React. We'll be using the Vite framework to quickly scaffold our React project, and React Syntax Highlighter to make the output CSS more readable. We'll also be adding a copy-to-clipboard functionality using React Copy to Clipboard, and using React Icons for some visual flair. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully-functional gradient generator app that outputs CSS code that you can use in your own projects. This video is perfect for beginners who are interested in learning how to use React, as we'll be walking through the entire process step-by-step.
